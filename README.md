# Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Solver

Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell (EPIC) is a research-grade PIC 
library written in C/C++ for research in plasma physics, 
electromagnetic propulsion, or general charged particle kinetics.

EPIC is meant to be a lightweight, compiled PIC that is easy
(and fun) to use. EPIC plans to be both usable in native
C++ applications or called seamlessly from Python for
quick analysis, prototyping, scripting, and visualization.

As EPIC sits at the midpoint of complex, industry-standard
PIC codebases and simple, but slow, toy PIC models, we want EPIC
to have three main characteristics: **robustness**, **agility**,
and **readability** (in no particular order).

#### Robustness
- The code should be physically correct for all scenarios.
- The code should work on all machines.
- The code should alert you if it breaks.

#### Agility
- The code should do what it is supposed to do as fast as it can.
- The code should contain minimal bloat.
- The code should allow for backend upgrades.

#### Readability
- The code should be modular.
- The code should be documented where it matters.
- The code should make it easy for others to extend or debug.


Work on the codebase is currently underway! Please contact
