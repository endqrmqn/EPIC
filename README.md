# Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Solver

Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell (EPIC) is a research-grade PIC 
library written in C/C++ for research in plasma physics, 
electromagnetic propulsion, or generalcharged particle kinetics.

The primary goals of this project are for the codebase to be
**robust**, **fast**, and **readable** (in no particular order).

#### Robust
- The code should be physically correct for all scenarios.
- The code should work on all machines.
- The code should alert you if it breaks.

#### Fast
- The code should do what it is supposed to do as fast as it can.
- The code should contain minimal bloat.
- The code should allow for backend upgrades.

#### Readable
- The code should be modular.
- The code should be documented where it matters.
- The code should make it easy for others to extend or debug.


Currently, the project's author is working on PIC code in Java
and will port it over when he is done with its use.
